## Introduction

DALL-E is a powerful model that can generate images based on textual input. 
It combines unsupervised learning with a variant of the VQ-VAE-2 model for image encoding and decoding. 
The model has been trained on a large dataset to understand the relationships between text and corresponding images.

## Getting Started

To get started with DALL-E, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nitha-ui/DALL-E.git

2. install the reactjs , mean stack tools 
## Usage
The DALL-E repository provides examples and code for using the model to generate images based on textual input. 
It may also include additional utilities and tools for working with the DALL-E model.
